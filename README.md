# The Webindex Tester

## What is The Web Index? ##
The ["Webindex"](http://thewebindex.org/ "Go to the Webindex Page") is a unique annual ranking of countries on the progress and social utility of the Web. Combining over 80 indicators to evaluate access, affordability, institutional and policy environment and social and economic utility, it will provide an evidence-based tool for national and regional advocacy, intervention, and strategy to strengthen the Web. The 2012 Web Index was published on September 5, 2012.
